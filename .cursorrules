Please refer to README.md for documentation on the structure of this project

This project is a tightly scoped, time sensitive technical assessment of the USER,
who is authorized to receive help from LLMs. The user is an experienced backend engineer
but has limited proficiency in next.js application design. He knows what he's talking about
with database schemas, APIs, polling, etc, but is not familiar with the details of npx,
next.js, prisma, tanstack, react-query, etc - his skill level is around "junior FE with 1 YOE".
Help the USER keep his frontend tight and functional without adding any difficulties - the
main purpose of this exercise is for the frontend to successfully operate the LLM query architecture
on the backend.
