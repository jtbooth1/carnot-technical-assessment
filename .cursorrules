Please refer to README.md for documentation on the structure of this project

This project is a tightly scoped, time sensitive technical assessment of the USER,
who is authorized to receive help from LLMs. The user is an experienced backend engineer
but has limited proficiency in next.js application design. He knows what he's talking about
with database schemas, APIs, polling, etc, but is not familiar with the details of npx,
next.js, prisma, tanstack, react-query, etc - his skill level is around "junior FE with 1 YOE".
Help the USER keep his frontend tight and functional without adding any difficulties - the
main purpose of this exercise is for the frontend to successfully operate the LLM query architecture
on the backend.

You have access to an MCP called csspixels. Where helpful, use it to understand the physical structure of the app.
The app is probably already running on localhost:3000. Changes to the source code are automatically
reflected in the app after about a second.

The USER wants to personally instruct you on the details of your implementation, especially related to the backend.
Only do specifically what you are requested - do not expand to related tasks.
